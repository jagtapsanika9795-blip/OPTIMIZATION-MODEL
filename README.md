## Overview
This project is part of Internship Task 4 and focuses on solving a real-world business optimization problem using Linear Programming techniques. The goal is to maximize profit under limited resources by building and solving an optimization model using Python and PuLP.
## Problem Statement
A manufacturing company produces two products:
Product A
Product B
Each product requires a certain number of machine hours and generates a specific profit per unit. The company has a limited number of machine hours available, and the objective is to determine the optimal number of units of each product to produce in order to maximize total profit.
## Objective
Maximize total profit
Efficiently utilize available machine hours
Apply Linear Programming concepts using Python
## Mathematical Formulation
Decision Variables
x = Number of units of Product A
y = Number of units of Product B

## Objective Function

Maximize: 40x + 30y
## Constraints
2x + y ≤ 100
x ≥ 0
y ≥ 0

## Tools & Technologies Used
Python
PuLP (Linear Programming Library)
